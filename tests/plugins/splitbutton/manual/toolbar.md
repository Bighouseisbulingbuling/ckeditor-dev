# Creating Split Button with `config.toolbar`

## Things to test:

- Check if Split Buttons and menu items are rendered properly with icons and labels.
- First Split Button have a static face, which means main button should look and work the same all the time.
- Second Split Button have a dynamic face, which means main button should match current active command.
